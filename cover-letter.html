            <section class="experience">
                <p>
                At Side Inc., I worked closely with engineers to
                debug and ship software solutions
                for our real estate partners. Through this, I gained hands-on experience in agile, user-focused development.

                Google’s commitment to innovation and overall impact strongly resonates with me,
                and I’m eager to bring my skills to such a dynamic environment. 
                I've been impressed by Google's products in every case and will bring my expertise 
                to atune Google's products to a state of perfection.
                </p>
