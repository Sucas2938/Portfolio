                    <h3>Dear Hiring Manager,</h3>
                    <p>
                    I’m excited to apply for the Software Engineering position at Google.
                    With experience in <em>software development and maintenance</em>,
                    I am <mark>confident in my ability</mark> to contribute to your team.
                    </p>

                <section class="experience">
                    <p>
                    At Side Inc., I worked closely with engineers to
                    debug and ship software solutions
                    for our real estate partners—gaining hands-on experience in agile, user-focused development.

                    <p>
                    Google’s commitment to innovation and overall impact strongly resonates with me,
                    and I’m eager to bring my skills to such a dynamic environment. 
                    I've been impressed by Google's products in every case and will bring my expertise 
                    to atune Google's products to a state of perfection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Thank you for your time and consideration.
                    You can reach me at fake@gmail.com or 555-555-555 to discuss further.
